# Profile Picture in Header - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

I've successfully updated the header component to display the user's profile picture. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Header Component Updates** (`src/components/header.tsx`)

- Added `useEffect` hook to fetch the custom avatar from the `profiles` table when a user is logged in
- Created state management for the custom avatar URL (`customAvatarUrl` and `avatarLoading`)
- Implemented logic to fetch the avatar from Supabase storage and get its public URL
- Added fallback logic:
  1. First priority: Custom avatar uploaded via the profile page
  2. Second priority: OAuth profile picture (from Google/GitHub login)
  3. Final fallback: First letter of the user's name

### 2. **Key Features**

- **Automatic Updates**: When a user uploads a new profile picture on the `/profile` page, it will automatically appear in the header after a page refresh
- **Multiple Sources**: The header now supports both custom uploads and OAuth profile pictures
- **Performance**: The avatar is fetched once when the component mounts and cached in state
- **Error Handling**: Includes try-catch blocks to handle any errors during avatar fetching

### 3. **How It Works**

1. When the header component loads, it checks if a user is logged in
2. If logged in, it queries the `profiles` table for the user's `avatar_url`
3. If an avatar URL exists, it gets the public URL from Supabase storage
4. The Avatar component displays the picture with the same styling as before (purple ring, hover effects)

### 4. **Testing**

To test the implementation:
1. Log in to the application
2. Go to `/profile` page
3. Upload a profile picture using the "Change Picture" button
4. Navigate to any other page (or refresh)
5. The profile picture should now be visible in the header

The implementation maintains backward compatibility - users who haven't uploaded a custom picture will still see their OAuth profile picture or the letter avatar as before.
