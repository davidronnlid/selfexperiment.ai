🚀 iOS PWA Push Notifications Setup Complete!

Your server-side push notification system is now ready. Here's what's been implemented:

✅ VAPID Keys Generation
✅ Database Schema for Push Subscriptions  
✅ Server-side Push Notification API
✅ Push Subscription Management Hook
✅ Updated Service Worker for Background Push
✅ Notification Manager with Push Controls
✅ Routine Notification Scheduler
✅ Complete Documentation

📋 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE SETUP:

1. 🔑 Add VAPID Keys to Environment:
   Run: node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.js
   Add the keys to your .env.local file

2. 🗃️ Setup Database Tables:
   Run: node scripts/setup-push-subscriptions-table.js
   Or copy SQL from database/push_subscriptions_schema.sql to Supabase

3. 🔄 Restart Development Server:
   npm run dev

4. 🧪 Test the System:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/account
   - Navigate to "Notification Settings"
   - Enable notifications and subscribe to server push
   - Test with "Test Server Push" button

5. 📱 Test on iOS PWA:
   - Install app via "Add to Home Screen"
   - Open from home screen (not Safari)
   - Enable notifications and test background delivery

6. ⏰ Setup Production Scheduling (Optional):
   - Configure cron job to call /api/send-routine-notifications
   - Recommended: every 10-15 minutes during active hours

🔧 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM BEFORE:

OLD WAY (Only worked when app is open):
- Used self.registration.showNotification() only
- No server-side push capability
- No background notifications on iOS

NEW WAY (Works even when app is closed):
- Server-side Web Push with VAPID keys
- Push subscriptions stored in database
- Background notifications via push service
- Full iOS PWA compatibility

📱 iOS PWA REQUIREMENTS:
- User must "Add to Home Screen" to install as PWA
- App must be opened from home screen (not Safari browser)
- Requires iOS 16.4+ for full support
- Must be served over HTTPS in production

🎯 TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ VAPID keys added to environment
□ Database tables created
□ Push subscription works in browser
□ Test notification sends successfully
□ Service worker receives push events
□ Notifications work when app is closed
□ iOS PWA installation and testing

📖 DOCUMENTATION:
- Complete guide: docs/IOS_PWA_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md
- API reference included
- Troubleshooting section
- Production deployment guide

🚨 IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTION:
- Keep VAPID private key secure
- Set up proper cron job for routine notifications
- Monitor notification delivery rates
- Test thoroughly on actual iOS devices

Your app now supports true background push notifications for iOS PWAs! 🎉
