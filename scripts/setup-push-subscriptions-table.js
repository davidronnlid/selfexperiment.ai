🔔 Push Subscriptions Database Setup

This script will help you set up the database schema for server-side push notifications.
==================================================

📋 Manual Database Setup Required:

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the SQL from database/push_subscriptions_schema.sql
4. Execute the SQL

Or copy this SQL directly:
==================================================
`);

// Read and display the SQL file
const sqlFilePath = path.join(
  __dirname,
  "../database/push_subscriptions_schema.sql"
);

try {
  const sqlContent = fs.readFileSync(sqlFilePath, "utf8");
  console.log(sqlContent);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("❌ Error reading SQL file:", error);
  console.log(
    "\n⚠️  Please manually create the database/push_subscriptions_schema.sql file"
  );
}

console.log(`
==================================================

🎯 After running the SQL:

1. Make sure you have added the VAPID keys to your environment:
   - Run: node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.js (if you haven't already)
   - Add the keys to your .env.local file

2. Test the push notification system:
   - Restart your development server
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/notifications-test
   - Enable notifications and test server push

3. Configure notification preferences:
   - Update user notification settings
   - Test background notifications on iOS PWA

✅ Your server-side push notification system will be ready! 🎉

📱 iOS PWA Requirements:
- User must "Add to Home Screen" (install as PWA)
- App must be opened from home screen (not Safari)
- User must grant notification permissions
- App must be served over HTTPS (in production)

🔧 Troubleshooting:
- Check browser console for subscription errors
- Verify VAPID keys are correctly set
- Ensure push subscriptions are being saved to database
- Test with different devices/browsers
