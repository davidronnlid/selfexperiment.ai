console.log("🔧 React Hooks Error Fix Applied!\n");

console.log("✅ FIXES APPLIED:");
console.log("1. ✅ Moved useState hooks to top level (not conditional)");
console.log("2. ✅ Combined loading states to prevent multiple returns");
console.log("3. ✅ Fixed TypeScript session null check");
console.log("4. ✅ Removed early return from auth check");

console.log("\n🎯 ROOT CAUSE:");

console.log("\n📋 RULES OF HOOKS:");
console.log("1. Only call hooks at the top level");
console.log(
  "2. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions"
);
console.log("3. Only call hooks from React functions");

console.log("\n🚀 EXPECTED RESULT:");
console.log("✅ Page should load without React error");
console.log("✅ Authentication check should work properly");
console.log("✅ Dashboard should show auth required message if not logged in");
console.log("✅ If logged in, should show data with pagination");

console.log("\n🔧 NEXT STEPS:");
console.log("1. 🔄 Refresh the analytics page");
console.log("2. 👀 Check if React error is gone");
console.log("3. 🔐 Make sure you're logged in");
